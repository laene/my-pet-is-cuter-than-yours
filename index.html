                Firefly is a German Shepherd mix. She turns 5 years old on January 12. She weighs 101 lbs! Firefly is
                allergic to chicken and lamb. She has horrible skin allergies, so she takes medicine and coconut oil
                with her expensive specialty food. She knows "sit", "come", "leave it", "drop it", "down", "off", and
                "Let's Go!". Her favorite game is sitting on the couch watching tv.
